# ML_p1 - Probably Interesting Data

This project was done by Caio Vigo & William Duncan.

In this repository you can find three files. They are:

(1) 'ML_p1-Probably Interesting Data.ipynb' is the Jupyter notebook running in python
(2) Dataset: 'german_credit_data.csv' 
(3) Dataset: 'adult.csv'

We seek to model the distributions of the some of the features from both datasates programmatically.
The main approach used was Gaussian Mixed Models in one dimension.
